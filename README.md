# Twilio_WhatsApp_API

WhatsApp Chatbot made using the Twilio WhatsApp API.

1. Testing for One-Way-Message can be found at satyakinkohli/Twilio_WhatsApp_API/twilio_test
2. A FLask application is used to fetch the message the bot and sender will send
3. The callback url for the Twilio API was first set using ngrok and then eventually deployed on Heroku. This is set on the Twilio Console
